EDP â€“ a program for projecting electron densities
=================================================

:program:`EDP` is a powerful C++ program designed to project electron density
onto a plane. With EDP, users can effortlessly define the projection plane
based on atomic positions while also having the option for detailed 
customization of the plane's position and direction. Its versatility and ease 
of use make EDP a handy tool for researchers in the field of materials science 
and beyond.

:program:`EDP` has been developed at the Eindhoven University of Technology,
Netherlands. :program:`EDP` and its development are hosted on `gitlab
<https://github.com/ifilot/edp>`_.  Bugs and feature
requests are ideally submitted via the `github issue tracker
<https://github.com/ifilot/edp/issues>`_.
