EDP â€“ a program for projecting electron densities
=================================================

EDP is a C++ program designed to project the electron density as stored in a
[CHGCAR](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/CHGCAR) or
[PARCHG](https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/PARCHG) file
(calculated in [VASP](https://www.vasp.at/), onto a plane.

With EDP, users can effortlessly define the projection plane based
on atomic positions while also having the option for detailed customization of
the plane's position and direction. Its versatility and ease of use make EDP
a handy tool for researchers in the field of materials science.
