# EDP

## Introduction
Electron density plotter is a tiny tool for generating electron density plots from VASP output.

## Compilation
EDP depends on a couple of libraries, which are normally directly available by your favorite package manager.
* Boost
* GLM
* Cairo
* TCLAP

Compilation is done using CMake
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../src
make -j5
```

## Usage
To run EDP, use the following command:

```
./edp -i <PATH_TO_CHGCAR> -v <v1,v2,v3> -w <w1,w2,w3> -p <p1,p2,p3> -o plot.png
```

There are 16 different color schemes built into EDP, which you can choose using the `-c` directive. If there are negative values in the density file, use the `-n` directive. Finally, to create a legend, use the `-l` directive.

## Color schemes

The following color schemes are built into EDP

## Tutorial
A short tutorial on using the program is provided in this [blog post](http://www.ivofilot.nl/posts/view/27/Visualising+the+electron+density+of+the+binding+orbitals+of+the+CO+molecule+using+VASP).
