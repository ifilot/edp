EDP â€“ a program for projecting electron densities
=================================================

:program:`EDP` is a C++ program designed to project the electron density as
stored in a `CHGCAR <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/CHGCAR>`_
or `PARCHG <https://www.vasp.at/wiki/index.php/PARCHG>`_ file
(calculated in `VASP <https://www.vasp.at/>`_), onto a plane. With :program:`EDP`,
users can effortlessly define the projection plane based on atomic positions
while also having the option for detailed customization of the plane's position
and direction. Its versatility and ease of use make EDP a handy tool for
researchers in the field of materials science.
